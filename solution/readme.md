## Installation
There are 2 unmanaged solution files which need to be imported into a Power Platform environment for the solution to work.
1 - Government Online Services - import this one first. This contains the Dataverse tables and Model Driven App.
2 - Government Online Services Portal - this contains the Power Pages web site and its related components. Once this has been imported, navigate to make.powerpages.microsoft.com, and select inactive web sites tab. You will find this government web site there, activate it and use it.
